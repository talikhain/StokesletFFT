# StokesletFFT

Two notebooks to numerically compute the Stokeslet velocity field. The Mathematica notebook "Stokeslet_Fourier_Space" can be used to analytically compute the velocity field in Fourier space for a fluid with a given viscosity tensor. Then, the Jupyter notebook "Invert_Stokeslet_FFT" can be used to numerically invert this expression to obtain the real space velocity field.
